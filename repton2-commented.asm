; Notes on the game
; =================
;
; Memory Relocation
; -----------------
; - Relocation code is sourced from REPTON1 which puts the code in $0700 
; - REPTON1 then runs REPTON2 with an execution address of $0700
; - Hence when REPTON2 loads, the relocation routine is called at $0700
; - REPTON2 loads at $1D00 and is moved down $1300 bytes 
; - It is moved from $1D00-$72FF to $0A00-$5FFF
;
; Code obfuscation
; ----------------
; - Code is EOR'd with $FF on disc/tape
; - When the relocation routine runs, it reverses this by EORing with $FF
;
; Code
; ----
; - Main game entry point is at fn_game_start ($2640)
; - Main game entry point is called by the memory relocation code above once complete
; - Escape is disabled and break clears memory (*FX 200,3) in REPTON1
; - Many zero page locations are overloaded (used for multiple things)
;   not an issue, just have to be aware when debugging / stopping the code
; - Variables are either in zero page or $09xx
; - There are many spare bytes (probably enough for another level) and small
;   fragments of unused code - assume the author wanted to maintain the 
;   memory locations hence NOP'd bits of redundant code.  Can also be 
;   seen when bits of a function are placed in anther "inbetween" subroutine
;   instead of in the main fn and then call the final subroutine direct
;   (oh to have modern tools back in the day)
;
; Bugs?
; -----
; - Sound channel never set correctly for monster crush sound
;   works by luck only - see fn_kill_monster
; - After Repton dies, and the explosions have animated there is a
;   half second wait and it then tries to play a sound but the first two parameters
;   aren't set properly so no sound every comes out i.e. 
;   SOUND &E0, 31, 4,2 - see fn_kill_repton This could have beena late development
;   change to stop the sound?
; - Music will not play if Sound is off - music only plays if both sound and music are on
;   (why not independent?)
; - $151B should be STY not LDY - doesn't seem to break anything
; - Monster information slots start at $0980 (OK) but the piece of code
;   that resets the monster cache starts at $0970 and clears up to $09EF
; - None of the above affets the great game experience thankfully
;
; Game Sounds
; -----------
; - Single envelope used defined at envelope_1
;   ENVELOPE 1,2,0,0,0,1,2,3,100,1,255,254,126,126
; - Monster crush sound (SOUND &60,1,1,1 or SOUND &92,1,1,1)
; - Diamond sound (SOUND &13,1,200,1)
; - Rock/egg dropping (SOUND &10,Amplitude,4,2)
;   Amplitude calculated as Amplitude = ((rock or egg y) / 4) - 15
; - Repton crunch sound (SOUND &10,-15,6,2)
; - Almost out of time sound (SOUND $10, -15, 10, 1)
;
; Score
; -----
; - Stored as binary coded decimal
; - A diamond is 50 points
; - A piece of Earth is 1 point
; - Repton is always placed on a piece of earth at the start to 
;   automatically get 1 point - this is used along with remaining
;   lives / time to see if a game has started when e.g. displaying
;   the start screen
;
; New Game Intro Music
; --------------------
; - Plays a sequence of 52 notes (see repton-music-intro-notes.asm)
; - Code and storage could play up to 64 but code stops at 52nd
; - Code that restricts the notes is at $2217
; - Music is across Channels 1, 2, 3
; - Main melody is in Channel 1
; - Occassional double stops / chords when Channel 2 and/or 3 have notes
;
; In Game Music
; -------------
; - Plays an (devilishly infuriating but) well put together sequence of 256 notes per channel
; - Music is documented in repton-main-music.asm
; - Music is across Channels 1, 2, 3
; - Channels 1 and 2 always play the same note 
; - Source code could have been reduced by 256 bytes if Channel 2
;   was coded to only play Channel 1 notes instead of reading its
;   own identical notes
; - Music continuously loops
; - Music controlled by VSYNC event (event happens every 20ms or 50 times a second)
; - VSYNC event triggers call to EVNT/EVENTV
; - EVNTV/EVENTV calls handler fn_enable_timer_2
; - fn_enable_timer_2 sets one shot countdown timer to 2,512 microseconds
; - IRQ2V is set to point at fn_event_handler_IRQ2V
; - When Timer 2 fires, it calls the routine above pointed at by IRQ2V
; - Routine only plays next music notes in sequence every 8th time around the loop
;   it does this by ANDing with $07 and checking for zero
; - It then clears the interrupt and disables Timer 2
; - Standalone music that can be compiled separately can be found in repton-music.asm
;
; Screen
; ------
; - Set up in REPTON1 before REPTON2 is loaded
; - Game runs in 4 colour MODE 5
; - Characters per line are set to 32 ($20) to reduce visible screen memory
; - and to simplify some of the maths
; - Visible screen memory is therefore $6000 - $7FFF (normally starts at $5800)
; - No offscreen buffering
; - During game, only the edges are updated as the new column scrolls into view
; - Only 32 different types of objects
;
; Colours
; -------
; - Defaults colours are Black, Red, Yellow, Green
; - Level colours are set to Black, <level specific>, Yellow, Green
; - <Level specific> colour is based on the zero based level number th ecolour
;   in a lookup table at data_screen_physical_colour_lookup
;
; Repton
; ------
; - Always starts a new level in the same position
; - When moving up/down or left/right the animation state is held in
;   var_repton_animation_state ($0905) including the explosion sequence at death
; - var_repton_idle_counter ($0906) is used to track game loops since last key press
; - If no key has been detected for 127 times around the main game loop
;   then the repton animation will change to the standing animation sequence
;
; Dissolve Screen
; ---------------
; - Routine that handles this is fn_dissolve_screen
; - VSYNC is disabled at the start of the routine
; - Uses a random number generator routine (see fn_generate_random_number for details)
; - To find a memory location for a random byte, it generates an address
; - MSB of the address is the (generated random number AND $F0) OR $E0 which
;   always gives a $F0xx or $E0xx MSB
; - Uses memory from $E000 to $F0FF for random byte values
; - The random byte values are ANDed with what is on the screen 
;   and written back to the screen
; - Iterates 14 times over the entire screen $6000-$7FFF which seems good enough
;   to dissolve most pixel
; - Dissolve iterations are controlled by zp_dissolve_screen_iterations
; - Value can be tweaked at $0D6B
; 
; Interrupts
; ----------
; - Start of VSYNC is used in game to set User VIA one shot Timer 2 timer
; - VSYNC triggers 50 times a second / every 20 ms
; - VSYNC is processed by redirecting EVNTV / EVENTV to fn_enable_timer_2
; - User VIA Timer 2 is used to trigger next on-game music
; - IRQV2 is used for when User VIA Timer 2 fires - used to play the in-game music
;
; Timers
; ------
; - User VIA Timer 2 is used for in-game music as above in Interrupts
; - Vertical sync is used as a wait/pause timer in multiples of 20ms
; - Code will loop waiting n times for vertical sync to reach the desired time limit
;
; Monsters
; --------
; - State is held in 6 bytes blocks from $0980
; - First empty (inactive) monster slot is used when a monster spawns
; - Maps have a maximum of 3 monsters
; - Code could have up to 20 (enough memory available) from $0980 to $09F7
; - Random number is generated and lowest bit used to determine if 
;   it should move up/down or left/right
; - Monsters "jitter" too
;
; Random Number Generation
; ------------------------
; - User VIA Registers Timer 1 High Order Counter and Low Order Counter
; - Documented in fn_generate_random_number
;
; Maps
; ----
; - Mini-maps are only shown for screens A - H, code stops it showing (mean!) for I-L
;
; - An object is an egg, or repton, rock, diamond, rounded corner, earth, wall segment etc
; - Each object has an id e.g. $1D for a rock or $1E for a diamond
; - An object is made up of 4x4 tiles 
; - Each object is therefore 16 tiles
;
; - Objects are mapped to component tiles in repton-map-objects-to-tile-defs.asm
; - The same tile can be used in multiple objects 
; - Maps can show 32x32 objects
; - Maps are therefore 128x128 tiles
;
; - (xpos, ypos) refers to a 128x128 tile co-ordinate
; - (x,y)        refers to a 32x32 object co-ordinate
; 
; - Off map areas (xpos or ypos > 127) default to the object defined at $1B4B
; 
; - Visible region of the map is 8x8 objects
; - Visible region of the map can therefore show 32x32 tiles
; - Visible region shows half an object at each edge, so 6 full objects are shown
;   and 2 half objects horiztontally and vertically
; 
; - Maps are stored as bit stream across bytes with every 5 bits identifying
;   an object id - they are not byte aligned however
; - The map is compressed in that 5 bits ar used to represent
;   each object so objects can have a value of $00 to $1F. Spare
;   bits are used for the next object so
;
;   Looking at Screen A, which starts at &4200 the first
;   5 bytes contain 8 object defintions (from &4200 to &4204)
;   with the rest following after (&4200++)
;

;
; - Current level map is decompressed and stored in $0400 to $07FF
;   for faster game time access
;
; File offsets
; ------------
; Offset in the REPTON2 file can be calculated with
;
; File offset = memory address - $0A00
