;
; General
; -------
; 1. Copies the custom WRCHV handler to $0400
; 2. Sets up the custom WRCHV vector and caches the original in IND1V
; 3. Changes the mode to 5
; 4. Defines logical colour 3 as physical colour green (2)
; 5. Sets characters per line to $20 / 32
; 6. Shifts the screen right because of (3) to centre it
; 7. Updates a bunch of OS workspace variables in $03xx because of 3, 5 and 6
; 8. Switches off caps lock
; 9. Sets hardware scrolling address to $6000 because of (3) above
; 10. Copies the graphic to the screen
; 11. Performs a *OPT 1,0 (OSBYTE equivalent) to suppress file system messages
; 12. Prints the "Press SPACE BAR." message
; 13. Moves the game relocation code to $0700
; 14. Performs a *RUN Repton2 using the File System Control Vector (FSCV)
;
; Custom WRCHV
; ------------
; 1. Contains a custom WRCHV routine that gets relocated to $0400 on load
; 2. The WRCHV custom routine calls the standard WRCHV (gets cached in IND1V) and then checks to see if carriage return was the character ($0D)
; 3. If it was a CR then it moves the cursor to (0,18) using OSWRCH $1F - only once, seems overkill to put this code in a custom WRCHV handler unless at some point there was scrolling text or multiple "steps" of text to work through.
; 4. Also processes moving the cursor down ($0A) but uses it as a control code to copy the memory from $7700-$7FFF to $7500-$7D00 but the memory it copies at this point is always blank. Feels like it was used for a text animation effect (moving up the screen) at some point but has no effect now.
;
; Main Graphic
; ------------
; 1. Displays the cool "man running from lizard" (iconic!) graphic
; 2. Just relocates this into screen memory
;
; CFS OS Workspace
; ----------------
; 1. Writes hardcoded values into the OS Workspace for the CFS BGET $03B0 - $03DF - doesn't do anything for my DFS :)
; 2. Haven't tried playing with this on a cassette yet and NOPing it to see if it "doesn't matter"
;
; Move Game Relocation Code
; -------------------------
;
; 1. Routine to move the code at $42F3 to $0700 - weirdly copies a full page even though it only needs the first 82 bytes, guess the subsequent bytes never get executed so no harm done.
;
; Game Relocation Code
; --------------------
;
; 1. This is executed as soon as the next file Repton2 is loaded
; 2. Repton2 contains the main game code
; 3. Repton2 loads at $1D00 onwards and has an execution address of $0700 - which is this relocated routine from Repton1
; 4. First thing it does is perform the OSBYTE equivalent of *TAPE12 presumably to quiesce the DFS
; 5. Copies the game code from $1D00-$72FF to $0A00-$5FFF
; 6. When it copies each byte it EORs with $FF to de-obfuscate
; 7. Then it restores the original WRCHV vector address from IND1V
; 8. Write zeros to $6000-$62FF (part of the visible screen) as code was there previously
; 9. Clears the text area (OSWRCH $0C)
; 10. Does the OSBYTE equivalent of *FX 200,3 (clear on break and disable escape)
; 11. Sets characters per line (again) to $20/32
; 12. Calls the relocated main game entry point at $2640
;
; Other Notes
; -----------
;
; There is a quite some clutter and junk in Repton1 including a duplicate 
; but different custom WRCHV handler that never does anything, many NOPs, 
; many spare bytes of EQUBs, code that can never be reached, some VDU23 
; equivalents that never get used. Even parts of the active WRCHV handler 
; can't be reached. So feels hastily thrown together or hacked by someone 
; or repurposed from a routine to load another game. It works though and 
; does the set up for the game.
